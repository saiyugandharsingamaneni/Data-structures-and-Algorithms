1. When I try to find number 5 in below list using binary search, it doesn't work and returns me -1 index. Why is that?
   numbers = [1,4,6,9,10,5,7]
   Answer: It is because the list is not sorted! Binary search requires that list has to be sorted

2. Find index of all the occurances of a number from sorted list?
  numbers = [1,4,6,9,11,15,15,15,17,21,34,34,56]
  number_to_find = 15  
  This should return 5,6,7 as indices containing number 15 in the array
